Notes for adyen python stuff
==============================


Basic tools
==========

* utils/cardPayment.py  - command line utility for making payments (including marketpay split payments)
* accountHolder.AccountHolder class - when run as main acts as a command line utility for creating new / reading existing accountHolder
* utils/accountHolderQuery - used to define views and filters of accountHolder data, can be used via command line


Test Cycle
============
* 1. endPoint via testEndPoint

* 2. cardPayment via testCardPayment and running cardPayment from command line:

  Basic payment to TEST marketplace merchant with alias 'JohnDickMarketPlace'
	cardPayment.py JohnDickMarketPlace --debug    

  As above but with 10 GBP, rehearse mode 
    cardPayment.py JohnDickMarketPlace --rehearse --value 1000 --currency GBP --mref '10 Pounds' --debug   
    
  As above but no rehearse
    cardPayment.py JohnDickMarketPlace --value 1000 --currency GBP --mref '10 Pounds' --debug   
    
  A bad marketpay split payment attempt 
    cardPayment.py JohnDickMarketPlace --value 1000 --currency GBP --mref '10 Pounds' --split --debug 
    
  A good marketpay split payment attempt - full split
    cardPayment.py JohnDickMarketPlace --value 1000 --currency GBP --mref '10 Pounds' --split 1000 --marketPayAccount 170523285 --debug 
 
  As above but partial split 
    cardPayment.py JohnDickMarketPlace --value 1000 --currency GBP --mref '10 Pounds' --split 500 --marketPayAccount 170523285 --debug 

  A live card attempt (leave rehearse switch on!) 
	cardPayment.py JohnDickMarketPlace --rehearse --live --debug    


3. accountHolder tests (via testAccountHolder and running accountHolder from command line)


To be done
==========

- more tests to accountHolder/testAccountHolder?
- add force to LimitlessPayout, LimitlessProcessing?


Nice to have
===============
- When creating a new accountHolder need to throw an exception if the accountCode already exists
